# Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists

## Overview

This Java project demonstrates the basic differences between arrays and ArrayLists in Java. It shows how each structure stores, accesses, and modifies elements, with code comments to explain their behavior.

## Description

- **Arrays** have a fixed size and can store primitive types like `int`. Once created, their size cannot change.
- **ArrayLists** are resizable and can grow or shrink dynamically. They store objects (e.g., `Integer`) and include methods like `.add()`, `.remove()`, and `.get()`.

## Key Differences

| Feature         | Array                        | ArrayList                      |
|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Size           | Fixed                        | Dynamic                        |
| Data Type      | Primitives (e.g., int)       | Objects (e.g., Integer)        |
| Flexibility    | Limited                      | High                           |
| Methods        | None                         | Many built-in utility methods  |

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the `DifferenceDemo.java` file.

```bash
javac DifferenceDemo.java
java DifferenceDemo
```

## Purpose

This project is for educational purposes to help beginners understand how arrays and ArrayLists work in Java.
